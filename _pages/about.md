I am currently pursuing my PhD in Air Transportation at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en/employee/alaki30). My research is on sustainable location of airports. I develop models to help transportation authorities efficiently allocate resources to a system of airports.

I am a statistician, operations researcher and data scientist working to assist organisations in making data-informed decisions. I have over 5 years of progressive experience in statistics, optimisation, machine learning and using tools such as Python, SQL, R, SAS, and Excel. My expertise includes data mining, data analysis and interpretation, and the development and implementation of decision support tools. 

I enjoy generating new ideas and solutions to problems. Currently, I am a co-founder of [Norrköping Data Science Community](https://www.meetup.com/Norrkoping-Data-Science-Community/), a mentor at [R4DS Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/), and a part-time consultant.
