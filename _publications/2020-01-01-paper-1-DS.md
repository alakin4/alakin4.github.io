excerpt: 'The aim of the work presented here is to develop a mathematical model that can assist decision-makers in selecting the optimal network of subsidised routes in air transportation. Sweden is used as a case study. The results show that even if most of the Swedish population already has a good accessibility, the model can suggest new routes that can further improve accessibility without increasing the subsidisation cost. The closure of an airport reduces the available commercial routes, which would impair the accessibility to a given destination; a subsidised route would hence be required as a replacement. The ability of the model to consider several accessibility criteria makes it useful for managers at transportation authorities when making airport location decisions.'
